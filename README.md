# RTOS developed for Microprocessors 2 Course at University of Florida

Threads of the RTOS are geared towards the idea of controlling a Hyperloop pod, for the Space X's (Now Boring Company) Hyperloop design competition. 
This was a project idea I had when working witb the Gatorloop design team, which was never fully implemented on the Gatorloop team Hyperloop pod.
